Summary: This solution creates a sample app in shell to print provided input. It deploy the applicaion in an EC2 automscaling group.

Tools:
Terraform: for infrastructure provisioning.
Shell: script for hellow world app.
github: source code.

Due to time constraints the terraform has single main file which contains all the provisioning code. I have not included many variables in the solution but it can be customized accordingly. Below components are provisionded in AWS for hosting the solution and considering auto scaling and cost.

1. VPC: virtual network
2. VPC components: security group, subnets(3), route tables, internet gateway
3. Load balancer: Distribute load across automatic scaling groups and manage high availability.
4. EC2 Autoscaling group: Create multiple instances across availibility zones.

To browse the application use Load balancer URL. DNS A record can also be created for custom URL but we have used LB url on port 80. To enable on https we would need a certificate.

To deploy this solution:
1. Clone the repository locally using github clone URL: https://github.com/bhushan7337/quantspark-test.git
2. Make sure terraform is installed on the local machine. Version used in 1.3.9. But it should work on versions 1.*
3. Create a new key pair in AWS and name it "ubuntu"
4. Run command below commands:
    terraform init
    terraform plan // check all resource creations
    terraform apply --auto-approve
5. After the deployment is complete, copy the load balencer URL and browse the same, in my case its (http://my-alb-867287883.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com)
